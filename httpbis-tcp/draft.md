# Introduction

HTTP version 1.1 {{RFC7230}} as well as HTTP version 2 {{RFC7540}} are defined
to use TCP {{RFC0793}}, and their performance can depend greatly upon how TCP
is configured. This document records best current practice for using HTTP over
TCP, with a focus on improving end-user perceived performance.

These practices are generally applicable to HTTP/1 as well as HTTP/2, although
some may note particular impact or nuance regarding a particular protocol
version.

There are countless scenarios, roles and setups where HTTP is being using so
there can be no single specific "Right Answer" to most TCP questions. This
document intends only to cover the most important areas of concern and suggest
possible actions.

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

# Socket planning

Your HTTP server or intermediary may need to tweak some sizes and timeout
periods to perform optimally. Changing limits and altering thresholds will
change behaviors, be aware. This is a list of values to consider and some
general advice on how they can be modified on Linux systems.

## Number of open files

A modern HTTP server will serve a large number of TCP connections and in most
systems each open socket equals on open file. Make sure that limit isn't a
bottle neck. In Linux, the limit can be raised like this:

    fs.file-max = <number of files>

## Number of concurrent network messages

Raise the number of packets allowed to get queued when a particular interface
receives packets faster than the kernel can process them. In Linux, this limit
can be raised like this:

    net.core.netdev_max_backlog = <number of packets>

## Number of incoming TCP SYNs allowed to backlog

The number of new connection requests that are allowed to queue up in the
kernel. In Linux, this limit can be raised like this:

    net.core.somaxconn = <number>

## Use the whole port range for local ports

To make sure the TCP stack can take full advantage of the entire set of
possible sockets, give it a larger range of local port numbers to use.

    net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65535

## Lower the TCP FIN timeout

Lower the timeouts during which connections are in FIN-WAIT-2 state so that
they can be re-used faster and thus increase number of simultaneous
connections possible.

    net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = <number of seconds>

## Re-use sockets in TIME_WAIT state

Especially when running backend servers that are having edge servers fronting
them to the Internet, allow reuse of sockets in TIME_WAIT state for new
connections when it is safe from the network stackâ€™s perspective.

    net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1

## Give the the TCP stack enough memory

Systems meant to handle and serve a huge number of TCP connections at high
speeds need a significant amount of memory for TCP stack buffers. On some
systems you can tell the TCP stack what default buffer sizes to use and how
much they are allowed to dynamically grow and shrink. On a Linux system, you
can control it like:

    net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = <minimum size <default size> <max size in bytes>
    net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = <minimum size <default size> <max size in bytes>

## Set maximum allowed TCP window sizes

You may have to increase the largest allowed window size.

    net.core.rmem_max = <number of bytes>
    net.core.wmem_max = <number of bytes>

## Timers and time-outs

Fail fast. Do not allow very long time-outs. Wasting several minutes for
various network related attempts won't make any users happy.

Avoid long-going TCP flows that are (seemingly) idle. Use HTTP continuations
instead, or redirects, 202s or similar.

# TCP handshake

## TCP Fast Open

TCP Fast Open (a.k.a. TFO, {{RFC7413}}) allows data to be sent on the TCP
handshake, thereby allowing a request to be sent without any delay if a
connection is not open.

TFO requires both client and server support, and additionally requires
application knowledge, because the data sent on the SYN needs to be
idempotent. Therefore, TFO can only be used on idempotent, safe HTTP methods
(e.g., GET and HEAD), or with intervening negotiation (e.g, using TLS).

Support for TFO is growing in client platforms, especially mobile, due to the
significant performance advantage it gives.

## Initial Congestion Window

{{RFC6928}} specifies an initial congestion window of 10, and is now fairly
widely deployed server-side. There has been experimentation with larger
initial windows, in combination with packet pacing.

IW10 has been reported to perform fairly well even in high volume servers.

## TCP SYN flood handling

TCP SYN Flood mitigations {{RFC4987}} are necessary and there will be
thresholds to tweak.

# TCP transfers

## Packet Pacing

TBD

## Explicit Congestion Control

Apple [deploying in iOS and OSX](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=719).

## Nagle's Algorithm

Nagle's Algorithm {{RFC0896}} is the mechanism that makes the TCP stack hold
(small) outgoing packets for a short period of time so that it can
potentionally merge that packet with the next outgoing one. It is optmized for
throughput at the expence of latency.

HTTP/2 in particular requires that the client can send a packet back fast even
during transfers that are perceived as single direction transfers. Even small
delays in those sends can cause a significant performance loss.

HTTP/1.1 is also affected, especially when sending off a full request in a
single write() system call.

In POSIX systems you switch it off like this:

    int one = 1;
    setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY, &one, sizeof(one));

## Keep-alive

TCP keep-alive is likely disabled - at least on mobile clients for energy
saving purposes. App-level keep-alive is then required for long-lived requests
to detect failed peers or connections reset by stateful firewalls etc.

# Re-using connections

## Slow Start after Idle

Slow-start is one of the algorithms that TCP uses to control congestion inside
the network. It is also known as the exponential growth phase. Each TCP
connection will start off in slow-start but will also go back to slow-start
after a certain amount of idle time.

In Linux systems you can prevent the TCP stack from going back to slow-start
after idle by settting

    net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle = 0

## TCP-Bound Authentications

There are several HTTP authentication mechanisms in use today that are used or
can be used to authenticate a connection rather than a single HTTP
request. Two popular ones are NTLM and Negotiate.

If such an authentication has been negotiated on a TCP connection, that
connection can remain authenticated througout the rest of its life time. This
discrepancy with how other HTTP authentications work makes it important to
handle these connections with care.

# Closing connections

## Half-close

Client or server is free to half-close after a request or response has been
completed; or when there is no pending stream in HTTP/2.

Half-closing is sometimes the only way for a server to make sure it closes
down connections cleanly so that it doesn't accept more requests while still
allowing clients to receive the ongoing responses.

## Abort

No client abort for HTTP/1.1 after the request body has been sent. Delayed
full close is expected following an error response to avoid RST on the client.

## Close Idle Connections

Keeping open connections around for subsequent connection re-use is key for
many HTTP clients' performance. The value of an existing connection quickly
degrades and already after a few minutes the chance that a connection will
successfully get re-used by a web browser is slim.
